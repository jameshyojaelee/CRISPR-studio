# Go-To-Market Plan

## Channel 1 – Personal Networks & Early Adopters
- Draft email template:
  > *Subject*: "Pilot CRISPR-studio on your latest screen"
  >
  > Hi <Name>,
  > We’ve built CRISPR-studio to turn pooled CRISPR sequencing reads into annotated hits and QC dashboards in minutes. I’d love to run your latest dataset and deliver an interactive report—no charge for early adopters. Can we connect this week?
  >
  > Cheers,
  > <Your Name>
- Lab demo agenda (30 mins): intro, live analysis of demo data, import their counts, Q&A.
- Goal: secure 3 pilot labs by Week 4.

## Channel 2 – Targeted Online Forums
- Biostars post outline:
  - Pain point summary referencing common “how do I analyse MAGeCK outputs?” questions.
  - GIF/screenshots of Dash workflow.
  - CTA to request a pilot run or download Docker image.
- Reddit r/labrats follow-up: reply in existing threads that flagged analysis struggles; provide before/after narrative.
- Measure click-through to landing page and pilot signups.

## Channel 3 – Conferences & Social
- Submit abstract to functional genomics workshops; include demo-ready screenshots and metrics (runtime, hit overlap).
- Prepare 3-slide lightning talk summarising problem, solution, and pilot testimonials.
- Social snippet (LinkedIn/Twitter): "Took BRCA-focused CRISPR screen from FASTQ to annotated hits in <5 minutes — DM for beta access."

## Pricing Thought Starters
- **Freemium**: free tier for datasets <5k guides; paid per-analysis for larger screens.
- **Subscription**: lab license ($299/mo) with unlimited analyses, email support.
- **On-Prem**: annual license + support SLA for biotech partners.

## Timeline
- **Week 1-2**: Collect pilot commitments, polish onboarding docs.
- **Week 3**: Publish landing page assets, soft-launch forum posts.
- **Week 4**: Present at institutional seminar; gather feedback forms (see docs/beta_feedback_plan.md).

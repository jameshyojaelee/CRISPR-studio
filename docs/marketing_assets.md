# Marketing Assets

## Landing Page Copy
- **Hero**: *"CRISPR-studio — CRISPR screen results at your fingertips."*
- **Subheading**: *Transform raw pooled CRISPR data into curated insights, QC guardrails, and publication-ready narratives in minutes.*
- **Primary CTA**: `Request a Demo`
- **Secondary CTA**: `Upload a Pilot Screen`

## Feature Highlights
- **End-to-End Automation**: Upload counts + metadata, receive MAGeCK-aligned hits, enrichment, and AI-assisted narratives.
- **QC Guardrails**: Replicate correlations, guide detection heuristics, and warnings surfaced automatically.
- **Biological Context**: Pathway enrichment, MyGene annotations, and interactive gene drill-down.
- **No-Code Reports**: Download HTML/PDF summaries ready for lab meetings and admissions showcases.

## Value Propositions
- **Wet-Lab Biologists**: Self-serve analytics without waiting on bioinformatics support; confidence via transparent QC badges.
- **Core Facilities**: Consistent reporting templates, background job orchestration, and easy handoff of artifacts.
- **Biotech Teams**: On-prem deployment with configurable privacy controls, optional LLM assistance for literature context.

## Visual Storyboard (to capture later)
1. Upload screen showing drag-and-drop inputs with validation checks.
2. Volcano plot with top genes labelled (BRCA2, ATM) and summary cards.
3. QC tab highlight showing replicate correlation badges.
4. Gene modal displaying annotations plus narrative snippet.
5. Report download confirmation overlay.

## Call-to-Action Ideas
- `Request Pilot Analysis` – invite labs to send a small dataset for white-glove onboarding.
- `Join the Beta Cohort` – limited seats, emphasise feedback-driven roadmap.
- `See the Live Demo` – link to demo runbook video once recorded.

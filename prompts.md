## Prompt 6 – Storytelling & Portfolio Polish
```
Finalize the project narrative:
1. Write a new `docs/case_study.md` that walks through problem, solution, tech stack,
   and demo highlights (include screenshots from the revamped Dash app & report).
2. Update `README.md` hero section with a short elevator pitch, animated GIF hero
   (place under `assets/hero.gif`), and CTA buttons (Demo Report, API Docs).
3. Add a `docs/resume_blurb.md` with bullet points you can paste into your CV and
   LinkedIn.
4. Create a `scripts/create_portfolio_assets.py` helper that zips key artefacts
   (report bundle, screenshots, API schema) into `artifacts/portfolio.zip`.
5. Ensure all docs reference the “Active development build” caveat appropriately and
   include next steps / roadmap summaries.

Here is my next project idea. what should i name this project:

2. CRISPRScreen-Expert – “CRISPR screen results at your fingertips – analysis to insights.”
	•	Pitch: A one-stop web platform that takes raw CRISPR screen read counts (or MAGeCK output) and delivers interactive results and biological context. It performs robust analysis (QC, hit calling) and then automatically annotates top hits with pathway enrichments, gene info, and even literature highlights (using an LLM). This turns a week-long manual analysis+interpretation process into an afternoon, no coding required.
	•	Target User & Buying Context: Biologists performing CRISPR screens who want to analyze data themselves without waiting for a bioinformatician. In academia, a core facility could use this tool to provide results to PIs. In industry, small biotech teams could integrate it in-house to quickly prioritize targets. Buying context: could be offered as an analysis service (upload data, get report) or licensed as on-prem software for companies concerned about data privacy. A free tier could handle small pilot screens to attract academic users.
	•	Admissions Impact (9/10): Very high. This directly leverages the candidate’s domain expertise (CRISPR screens) – any PI in bioengineering or genomics will appreciate the depth and practicality. Showing a live demo of taking FASTQ count data to results in a slick UI (perhaps highlighting a known dependency or discovery) would be compelling. It also demonstrates full-stack ability: statistical acumen (using the right algorithms ￼), software engineering (web interface), and even some AI (for literature highlights). It addresses a pressing need evidenced by forum posts ￼, so faculty will recognize its value.
	•	4-Week Feasibility (8/10): High. The heavy lifting analysis algorithms are available (MAGeCK is open-source and could be invoked, or python implementations of hypergeometric tests for depletion screens). Implementing a basic pipeline (guide count normalization, calculating fold-changes, p-values) is straightforward using existing libraries. Visualization components (volcano plots, ranked gene lists) can be adapted from libraries or prior art (MAGeCKFlute’s plots ￼). The interpretation part: pathway enrichment can be done via libraries (like gseapy for GSEA). Literature context can be fetched via an API (e.g., using NCBI E-utilities or an LLM to summarize known function of top genes). A simple prototype could just link out to GeneCards or PubMed for each hit; a more advanced one uses an LLM to generate a short “gene X is involved in Y” blurb. Given PinAPL-Py exists with similar core functionality (no-code analysis) ￼, we know it’s feasible; we would add value with the interpretation layer. Using an LLM coding agent will help glue these components and possibly generate parts of the UI code quickly. One potential crunch: ensuring the platform can handle large datasets in reasonable time (a genome-wide screen with 20M reads) – but we can optimize by running key steps in Python and summarizing results for the web front-end.
	•	Monetization (8/10): Strong potential. Labs often outsource bioinformatics analysis – either by hiring or paying core facilities. A polished tool could be sold as a subscription or per-analysis fee. For instance, a company like Synthego or a CRO might integrate this to add value to their screening services. Alternatively, a SaaS model where an academic lab pays a modest monthly fee for unlimited use (cheaper than a grad student’s time for each analysis). Since CRISPR screening is widely used in biotech for target discovery, a specialized tool has B2B potential (perhaps license to pharma with custom data privacy). Ads or freemium: could attract the community (maybe sponsored by reagent companies). Market signal: Users in forums were even advised to hire freelancers for analysis if stuck ￼ – indicating budget exists to solve this problem. By capturing some of that via a software service, there’s monetization headroom.
	•	Competitive Alternatives: PinAPL-Py (academic, free) is a close predecessor; it proved demand (users loved its ease ￼). However, PinAPL-Py might not be actively maintained, has queue delays, and doesn’t do advanced interpretation. MAGeCK-Flute is a pipeline in R that produces static reports ￼, but not interactive and requires R know-how. Commercially, GenePattern’s CRISPR module or Illumina’s BaseSpace could offer some analysis, but not sure if they do CRISPR screens well. Also, proprietary platforms (e.g., Microsoft’s Azure Machine Learning has a Genomics suite) might handle it, but again not interpretation. Our wedge is combining robust open algorithms with an AI-driven narrative. For example, after computing hits, our tool might say: “Top hits include BRCA2 – a DNA repair gene, which makes sense given your library was cancer-focused ￼.” That kind of insight currently comes only from the scientist’s brain or an hours-long literature search.
	•	Unique Wedge: Integration of analysis and domain knowledge. Many tools stop at giving you p-values. CRISPRScreen-Expert goes further: integrating gene function knowledge (via LLM or curated database) to help users go from data to biological story in one place. Also, focus on ease-of-use (inspired by the rave review of PinAPL-Py’s no-coding approach ￼) is key. The evidence that wet-lab scientists flock to easy tools ￼ and often struggle to interpret hits suggests this combined offering will stand out. Additionally, we can incorporate QA – e.g., the tool could warn if control guides aren’t behaving or if there’s a global shift indicating a library issue (something a biologist might miss). That kind of “expert system” element is differentiating.
	•	Risks & Mitigations: One risk is over-reliance on algorithms – e.g., if a user’s experiment doesn’t fit assumptions (maybe a custom screening modality), the tool might mis-analyze. Mitigation: allow advanced settings and clearly state methods used (so savvy users trust it, novices at least know what’s under the hood). Another risk is data privacy for any cloud version (especially for industry users). Mitigation: offer a local/offline version or ensure secure encryption and deletion after analysis. Also, the LLM interpretation could mis-summarize literature (hallucinations). Mitigation: restrict it to pulling actual data (like gene summaries from a reliable database) or citing sources. Providing the interpretation as a helping tool rather than final truth is important (e.g., label it “AI-generated summary, verify before use”). Lastly, competition from free academic tools: we should move fast to implement advanced features and possibly collaborate with known tool developers to gain credibility.




Problem & Users: Biologists running CRISPR/Cas9 pooled screens face difficulty analyzing the data and extracting meaningful hits ￼. Current solutions require bioinformatics skills or piecing together multiple tools (counting reads, statistical scoring, plotting, then doing literature search on hits) ￼ ￼. Our users are bench scientists or translational researchers (e.g., in a cancer lab doing a genome-wide knock-out screen) who want a one-stop, reliable analysis pipeline and easy-to-understand results. They may have time pressure from a PI to “get the screen results by end of the month” and limited computational expertise. They care about accuracy (not missing real hits, not chasing false positives), and they appreciate user-friendly interfaces.

Jobs-to-be-Done:
	•	Primary Job: From raw sequencing counts (FASTQ or count matrix) of a CRISPR screen, identify the genes that are significantly enriched or depleted (depending on screen type) ￼.
	•	Secondary Job: Provide quality control (did the library cover well, do replicates correlate, etc.) and highlight any technical issues (e.g., if a sample failed or if overall selection was weak).
	•	Secondary Job: Contextualize the hits biologically – e.g., perform pathway enrichment, show known functions of top genes, identify if hits are common essential genes or specific.
	•	Emotional Job: Give the scientist confidence presenting the results, by providing publication-ready plots and evidence that key hits make sense (or plausible hypotheses if not obvious). They should feel the analysis is thorough and not worry that they might have mis-analyzed (which they would if doing manually with little experience) ￼.

Solution Overview: CRISPRScreen-Expert is a web-based platform (could also have a command-line backend for integration) where users upload their screen data and get an interactive report. The workflow: (1) User uploads either raw FASTQ files or a table of read counts per sgRNA per sample. (2) The platform asks for some metadata – e.g., which samples are control vs treatment (for enrichment screens) or early vs late timepoint (for dropout screens), or replicates. It could have presets for common experimental designs (like depletion screen with replicates). (3) On “Run Analysis”, the backend performs: read count aggregation (if FASTQs given, it will map reads to sgRNA library – possibly via Bowtie or a simple exact match using provided library sequences), normalization (e.g., library size normalization or using control guides), statistical scoring using something like MAGeCK-RRA for gene-level hits ￼. (4) It generates output including volcano plots of gene scores, tables of top hits (with FDR q-values), and diagnostic plots (replicate correlation plots, GC bias check, etc.). (5) Then the Expert part: for the top N hits, it fetches gene information – e.g., brief description, known pathways, maybe shows if multiple genes in a pathway scored (enrichment). Possibly uses an LLM to summarize any interesting pattern (like “Several hits are in the TNF-alpha signaling pathway, suggesting X”). It flags known common essential genes if it’s a viability screen (so user knows if they see e.g. ribosomal proteins, which might be expected core essentials). (6) The UI presents these results in a dashboard format: interactive gene list (click a gene to see its stats and info), interactive plots (hover to see gene names). Also a downloadable static report (PDF/HTML) is produced for sharing. Scope wise, the initial version focuses on pooled knockout screens (with read count data). It may not handle CRISPRi or CRISPRa with different scoring methods in the initial month (though MAGeCK can do negative selection and positive selection similarly), and it won’t attempt single-cell perturb-seq analysis in v1 (that’s a different complexity). Non-goals: Not designing the library – assume a library is given; not analyzing beyond first pass (the tool won’t do follow-up experiments obviously). Also, it’s not a cloud computing service for terabytes of FASTQ in the MVP – we assume manageable input size or that counts are provided to keep compute light.

Users & Use Cases in Detail:
	•	A grad student did a genome-wide drop-out screen to find genes required for cell growth under a drug. They have sequencing results from control and drug-treated cells, with replicates. They use our tool to identify which genes, when knocked out, drop out more in drug (thus potential drug resistance genes). The tool outputs a ranked list with a clear top set and highlights “hey, many of these are in DNA repair pathway.” The student uses the plots directly in lab meeting and trusts the stats because QC metrics looked good (e.g., replicates had R^2 > 0.9). They also save time as the tool automatically did what would have taken them days and potentially errors.
	•	A biotech scientist performed a custom sublibrary screen for a particular pathway. They upload counts, get results quickly, and then use the tool’s API (future) to integrate into their internal pipeline.
	•	A core facility staff might run this for multiple groups; the standardized output ensures consistency across screens, which they appreciate.

Feature Scope:
	•	Data Input & Processing: Accept FASTQ (upload or from cloud storage link) – optional if user has them – and library CSV (guide-to-gene mapping). Or accept an already-counted matrix (CSV of guide counts per sample). Provide templates and guidance (the UI can have an example file to download to format their data). For MVP, focusing on already counted data might be faster (less heavy lifting than parsing FASTQs).
	•	Statistical Analysis: Implement (or wrap) MAGeCK’s core steps ￼. Specifically: for depletion screens, use RRA to get gene-level p-values; for enrichment (if indicated), similarly handle by looking at top guides increasing. Possibly include an option to use a simple model like edgeR (treat counts as RNA-seq) for quick gene calling as a cross-check. But MAGeCK is a proven tool in literature ￼, we can use its Python implementation or call the R package in background.
	•	Quality Control: Calculate summary stats: library coverage (did all guides get reads? if a lot have zero reads, warn), replicate correlation (with interactive scatter or bar showing Pearson), an overdispersion plot (expected vs observed count variance). Also show distribution of control guides if present (e.g., non-targeting sgRNAs distribution of logFC – expecting near zero). If any metric falls outside normal ranges, flag it (like “Replicates are poorly correlated – results might be noisy”).
	•	Results Visualization:
	•	Volcano plot of gene score vs significance (points clickable to show gene name and maybe a link to e.g. PubMed).
	•	Ranked barplot of top hits with color coding by direction (essential vs enriched).
	•	Option to filter by FDR or rank to focus.
	•	Table of results with gene, score, p-value, FDR, and an “info” button.
	•	Biological Context Integration: When user clicks “info” for a gene or views the top list, the tool displays gene description (pulled from NCBI gene summaries or Uniprot). It also might show if the gene is in a common pathway or complex if our database knows (for instance, highlight if multiple ribosomal proteins are hits). Perhaps an enrichment analysis: automatically run GSEA or hypergeometric enrichment on top 100 genes for KEGG pathways or GO terms, show a small panel of enriched categories with p-values ￼. If an LLM is available, we could generate a one-sentence commentary: e.g., “Top hits are significantly enriched in the p53 signaling pathway (4 of top 20 genes), suggesting the drug may induce p53-related stress.” This part is bonus if time permits; at minimum, listing enriched pathways with their names is good.
	•	Interactive Reporting: The output should be navigable, possibly as an HTML page if not a live server. The user can expand sections (like “Quality control details”, “Hit identification”, “Pathway analysis”). They can export plots and tables. Possibly an option to export an analysis report text (some paragraphs summarizing results, which could be generated by an LLM). That is ambitious for MVP, but maybe an outline with key numbers plugged in (like “We identified X significant hits (FDR < 0.1). Top hits include Y, Z… Replicate correlation was 0.95, indicating high data quality.” – a template can produce that).

Out-of-Scope (for initial version): Single-cell CRISPR screen analysis (sceptre etc.), CRISPR screen design or primer design (different stage of pipeline), extremely custom stats models (we stick to proven ones). We also won’t support CRISPRbase editing outcome analysis (like ICE) – focus is on functional screens. Not doing active learning or complex time series multi-condition logic beyond basic two-group or two-condition comparisons in v1.

User Stories & Acceptance Criteria:
	1.	Story: As a wet-lab biologist, I want to analyze my CRISPR drop-out screen without writing code, and trust that the results are valid.
	•	Acceptance: After uploading my count data and specifying control vs treatment, I click run and within a couple of minutes get a list of gene hits with FDR values. The output highlights e.g. “BRCA2 (FDR 1e-5)” and indeed, I expected DNA repair genes to come up. The tool shows that replicates had good correlation and notes “Screen depth ~ 300x per guide achieved – adequate” reassuring me of data quality. I can get all this without R or Python coding.
	2.	Story: As a core facility analyst, I want a consistent report for any screen I run, so PIs can easily understand it.
	•	Acceptance: Using CRISPRScreen-Expert on two different screens yields reports with a consistent structure: summary at top (how many guides, how many significant hits), then plots, then tables. The PIs find it intuitive and particularly like the volcano plot and that each hit has gene info attached. They did not inundate me with follow-up questions like “what does this gene do?” because the report already had that information.
	3.	Story: As a researcher, I want to quickly see if my hits make sense biologically (are they in known pathways or random?), to help decide next steps.
	•	Acceptance: The tool’s “Pathway enrichment” section shows, for example, “DNA damage response – 5 genes, p=1e-4” for my screen, which aligns with my hypothesis that the drug targets DNA repair. It increases my confidence that the top hits share a common theme and I should pursue that. If the hits were random, I’d see no significant pathways, which would caution me. This automated context saves me manual literature lookup.
	4.	Story: As a power user, I want to be able to adjust some parameters (like if I want to use a specific scoring method or adjust FDR cutoff in plots).
	•	Acceptance: The interface allows advanced options (maybe hidden under an “Advanced” toggle): e.g., I can choose “use robust rank aggregation (RRA) – default” or “use edgeR exact test” as alternative, or change the significance threshold for highlight on the volcano. Even if I don’t change them, knowing they’re there makes me confident the tool isn’t too rigid. The default results match those I later get using my own MAGeCK command, confirming correctness.

Metrics for Week-4 Demo:
	•	Process a real example dataset (possibly a small-scale library or a published screen) end-to-end and show results that match published findings. Metric: In demo, highlight that “Our top 5 hits include 4 out of 5 that the original Nature paper reported ￼ – showing our pipeline’s accuracy.”
	•	Speed: For a small demo (maybe 1000 guides, 2 conditions, 2 replicates), analysis completes in <30 seconds (we’ll likely pre-run or use a subset for live speed). For full dataset (like 60k guides, 4 samples), maybe a few minutes – acceptable if precomputed for demo narrative. We’ll note that if using our pipeline with optimized code, even genome-wide can be done in a couple minutes with compiled code.
	•	UI clarity: We’ll measure success by how easily a new user can interpret the output. For demo, one metric is that no one on the committee needs to ask “what does this plot mean” – implying our labels and explanations are clear. E.g., our QC section will have a short text “Replicate correlation: 0.92 (Good)” on the plot.
	•	Monetization interest: Not directly needed for demo, but we could mention that in limited beta, X number of labs expressed interest or already used it on their data (if we manage a pilot with a friend’s dataset). E.g., “3 labs from our institute plan to use this for their upcoming screens – indicating real demand.”
	•	Stability: The tool should handle at least one slightly messy input gracefully for demo. Perhaps have an example where one replicate has an issue – the tool would flag it but still produce output. Metric: it doesn’t crash on such input; it surfaces warnings in the report.

Technical Implementation Plan:
	•	Use Python (with possibly some R calls) because MAGeCK is primarily R, but there’s a Python wrapper (MAGeCK-VISPR) or we can call R via rpy2. Alternatively, reimplementing the core stat in Python (RRA algorithm is not too complex). Python allows easy integration of web frameworks and libraries like Plotly for interactive plots.
	•	Libraries:
	•	Counting: If needed, Bowtie for mapping reads to sgRNA (but could avoid FASTQ for MVP due to time).
	•	Data: Pandas for count tables, NumPy for calcs.
	•	Stats: Use existing MAGeCK if possible (maybe run as subprocess for speed, since reimplementing carefully might take time). Or use a simpler model from scratch (e.g., edgeR via rpy2 for quick gene p-values).
	•	Web UI: Possibly Flask + some JS for dynamic plots, or a Python dashboard framework like Plotly Dash or Streamlit for rapid development. Dash might be better for interactive callbacks (click gene, show info). Streamlit is simpler but a bit linear; Dash gives a more app-like feel. For a demo, Streamlit could suffice for simplicity (we can show interactive altair/plotly charts in it).
	•	Pathway analysis: Use gseapy (a Python GSEA library) or goatools for GO enrichment. Could also query Enrichr’s API (very quick route) with top genes and retrieve results ￼.
	•	Literature/gene info: Use Entrez (NCBI E-utilities) to get gene summaries, or MyGene.info API for quick gene descriptions. For references, maybe link to PubMed search of gene+screen context rather than LLM due to time. If an LLM is readily accessible, we can use a prompt to summarize in one sentence (similar to what we do in product 1, but here the prompt is simpler: “What does gene X do in context of Y cells?” – might not risk it for demo stability).
	•	LLM coding agent usage: The agent can assist in generating code for uploading files, doing plotting (like it can write a volcano plot snippet with Plotly). It can also help transform R code from MAGeCK’s manual into Python. For example, prompt it with “Using pandas, how to implement the robust rank aggregation given per-guide p-values?” and refine from there. We’ll also use it to quickly draft HTML or markdown templates for the report. Testing code: have it generate some unit tests for edge cases (like what if a gene has only one guide? the pipeline should handle it gracefully with a warning).
	•	Data pipeline example: We might integrate a small known dataset (maybe Achilles screen data or a demo from MAGeCK paper) as part of tests to ensure the pipeline matches known output.
	•	Stack considerations: If building a web UI, deployment in 4 weeks is possible on a server or local. For demo to committee, we can run it locally. For actual user tests, maybe host on Heroku or similar with limited resources. The code will be open (later on GitHub with DOI via Zenodo as per artifact plan).
	•	Licenses: MAGeCK is open-source (BSD), so using it is fine. Genes and pathways data are public. No proprietary needs. If we embed any known dataset in app for demo (like 10x demo data), it’s open. The UI code and pipeline we create will be MIT or similar. We should note if using OpenAI API for any text summary – similar privacy concerns as above; likely avoid sending any sensitive details (just gene names, which aren’t sensitive, so minimal issue).

Security & Privacy:
Data uploaded could be sensitive if it indicates, say, a proprietary drug or gene target. For our purposes, initially assume academic use (not highly confidential), but we still treat data securely: if using a cloud version, use HTTPS, don’t store data beyond analysis, and allow users to delete their session results. The tool doesn’t need personal identifiers; even sample names can be generic. We will ensure any web deployment has authentication for saving results (or just do stateless where no one else can access your upload). If we incorporate an LLM for summary, again only gene names and general findings would be sent, which is low sensitivity (the user can opt out by disabling that feature if they worry). In a SaaS scenario, we’d have to promise confidentiality (like not retaining the uploaded count data). For demo, likely local usage, so not a big issue. Also, since the product is analysis, there’s not PII – just experimental data. We should mention compliance if targeting companies (e.g., data not leaving secure environment if they self-host).

Go-to-Market (First 3 Channels):
	1.	Personal Networks & Early Adopters: We can reach out to labs in our institution who do CRISPR screens (maybe 1-2 known labs) and offer to test their recent data with our tool. Getting a testimonial or even a mention that “we saved so much time” would help. Also, leverage any core facilities – if an informatics core person tries it and likes it, they’ll tell others. These early users can also become champions. For channel: direct email and small demo sessions in those labs.
	2.	Online forums (targeted): Post about it on relevant forums like Biostars (there are often questions “How to analyze CRISPR screen data as a beginner” ￼ – we can now answer: “Use CRISPRScreen-Expert, it automates MAGeCK and more ￼!”). Also r/labrats, where the pain story originally came from ￼, would appreciate seeing a tool solution – follow up in that thread or a new post describing how we addressed exactly what the user needed.
	3.	Conferences / Hackathons: In the slightly longer term, present at a venue like the CIML (Computational Immunology) or functional genomics workshops. But within the first outreach, perhaps a short abstract to a local genomics symposium or a poster can be effective. If any SBIR or grant from NIH about screening tools (they often fund such dev), mention the tool in context. For immediate impact, possibly a tweet tagging e.g. “@AddgeneTech” or known CRISPR folks with a concise demonstration could get retweets (Addgene’s blog might even feature it if it’s useful, since they discuss CRISPR methods). The tool can be free for academics which encourages word-of-mouth.

Demo Script (3 minutes):

Setting: Show an example of a CRISPR screen analysis via the web UI. Suppose we have a demo dataset (e.g., a small library targeting DNA repair genes where we know expected hits like BRCA1/2 pop out under some stress). We’ll simulate the user perspective.
	1.	Intro (20s): “CRISPRScreen-Expert automates the analysis of pooled CRISPR knockout screens, from raw data to biological insights, with no coding. Let’s analyze a real screen.” (Quickly mention this is a drug resistance screen example, so context is clear.)
	2.	Data Upload (30s): (On screen, drag-and-drop or show input fields). “I have two conditions – DMSO vs Drug – with two replicates each. I upload the sgRNA count file and specify which columns are control and which are treatment.” (Show a simple form where the user tags samples or selects an experimental setup template like “Treatment vs Control”.) “I also upload the library file linking guides to genes.” (The interface lists number of guides, etc., verifying input.)
	3.	Run Analysis (10s): “Now I hit ‘Analyze’. The tool is counting reads, normalizing, and performing statistical analysis (using the well-known MAGeCK method in the backend).” (Perhaps show a small spinner or progress indicator. Quickly move on, as time is short – maybe even say “I ran this analysis earlier due to time.”)
	4.	Key Results – Hits (60s): “Done! Here’s the interactive report. Right at the top, we see ‘15 gene hits identified (FDR < 0.1)’. The volcano plot here shows gene enrichment in the drug condition.” (Point to a volcano plot where points on right are enriched under drug, labeled with gene names like BRCA2, ATM, etc.) “Notice BRCA2 and ATM are top hits – these are DNA repair genes. That makes sense: knocking them out confers drug resistance, so they’re enriched. The tool highlights them automatically.” ￼ (Hover or click BRCA2 to show details.)
Click BRCA2: “When I click a gene, I get details: BRCA2’s score, significance, and a short description: ‘BRCA2: DNA repair gene; loss may allow survival under this drug (based on pathway XYZ)’. It even cites a reference.” (That might be via an LLM or a pre-stored description – either way, mention the info.)
“You can see a table below with all significant hits sorted by score. And on the right, there’s an automatic pathway analysis – it shows ‘DNA damage response’ is the top enriched pathway among hits (p=1e-5). So the tool not only finds hits, it also tells you the biological theme.” ￼
	5.	Quality Control & Reliability (30s): “CRISPRScreen-Expert also assures you the data is good. For example, it reports replicate correlations: here it’s ~0.95, which it marks as Excellent. And it shows that 99% of your library guides were detected – no major sequencing dropouts. These QC panels are right here – green checkmarks indicate things are in good shape.” (Scroll to a QC section with a small replicate scatter plot and coverage stat, with green or red icons.) “If something was wrong – say one replicate failed – it would flag it in red with a note, so you’re immediately aware.”
	6.	Ease of Use & Export (20s): “All these results are interactive. I can filter the table for specific genes, or zoom in plots. When I’m ready, I hit Download Report – it gives me a nicely formatted PDF/HTML with all this content. That’s lab-meeting or supplement-ready. The whole process took ~2 minutes, far shorter than manually doing these steps and potentially making mistakes.” ￼ (If time, mention that the platform can easily handle whole-genome screens and we’ve tested it on known datasets – showing parity with published results.)
	7.	Conclusion (10s): “In summary, CRISPRScreen-Expert democratizes CRISPR screen analysis. It ensures that even researchers without computational training can get reliable results and glean biological insights in one go. In my own work, this tool allowed me to rapidly validate that our screens hit the expected pathways, giving us confidence to move forward with the candidates.” (End on that real-world benefit note, possibly mention potential to adapt it for CRISPRi or single-cell screens in future.)

This script demonstrates a clear before-and-after: it emphasizes how tasks described as painful by a Reddit user (like combining steps and understanding output) ￼ are all taken care of, and the result is intuitive and biologically informative ￼. It also subtly shows the candidate’s depth (mentioning MAGeCK, QC norms, etc.). The excitement comes from seeing recognizable gene hits and how everything lines up with expectations – which faculty will recognize as a sign the tool is robust. The demo also highlights time savings and error reduction, key practical points.

(We will prepare contingency in case the live compute is slow: either pre-generate results and just navigate them, or use a smaller dataset for the live run. The focus will be on interpretation and ease.)
